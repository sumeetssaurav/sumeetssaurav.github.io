                                        Machine learning (ML) has become a prevalent approach to tame the complexity of design space exploration for domain-specific architectures. While appealing, using ML for design space exploration poses several challenges. First, it is not straightforward to identify the most suitable algorithm from an ever-increasing pool of ML methods. Second, assessing the trade-offs between performance and sample efficiency across these methods is inconclusive. Finally, the lack of a holistic framework for fair, reproducible, and objective comparison across these methods hinders the progress of adopting ML-aided architecture design space exploration and impedes creating repeatable artifacts. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce ArchGym, an open-source gymnasium and easy-to-extend framework that connects a diverse range of search algorithms to architecture simulators. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate ArchGym across multiple vanilla and domain-specific search algorithms in the design of a custom memory controller, deep neural network accelerators, and a custom SoC for AR/VR workloads, collectively encompassing over 21K experiments. The results suggest that with an unlimited number of samples, ML algorithms are equally favorable to meet the user-defined target specification if its hyperparameters are tuned thoroughly; no one solution is necessarily better than another (e.g., reinforcement learning vs. Bayesian methods). We coin the term "hyperparameter lottery" to describe the relatively probable chance for a search algorithm to find an optimal design provided meticulously selected hyperparameters. Additionally, the ease of data collection and aggregation in ArchGym facilitates research in ML-aided architecture design space exploration. As a case study, we show this advantage by developing a proxy cost model with an RMSE of 0.61% that offers a 2,000-fold reduction in simulation time. Code and data for ArchGym is available at https://bit.ly/ArchGym.

                            Exploiting data locality in GPGPUs is critical for efficiently using the smaller data caches and handling the memory bottleneck problem.
                            This paper proposes a thread block-centric locality analysis, which identifies the locality among the thread blocks (TBs) in terms of a number of common data references.
                            In LocalityGuru, we seek to employ a detailed just-in-time (JIT) compilation analysis of the static memory accesses in the source code and derive the mapping between the threads and data indices at kernel-launch-time. Our locality analysis technique can be employed at multiple granularities such as threads, warps, and thread blocks in a GPU Kernel. This information can be leveraged to help make smarter decisions for locality-aware data-partition, memory page data placement, cache management, and scheduling in single-GPU and multi-GPU systems.

                            The results of the LocalityGuru PTX analyzer are then validated by comparing with the Locality graph obtained through profiling. Since the entire analysis is carried out by the compiler before the kernel launch time, it does not introduce any timing overhead to the kernel execution time.

                            The leakage energy of GPGPU can be reduced by power gating the idle logic or undervolting the storage structures; however, the performance and reliability of the system degrade due to large wake-up time and inrush current at the time of activation.
                            In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the realistic Break-Even Time (BET) and inrush current for various components in GPGPU architecture considering the recent design of multi-modal Power Gating Switch (PGS). Then, we introduce a new PGS which covers
                            the current PGS drawbacks. Our redesigned PGS is carefully tailored to minimize the inrush current and BET. GPGPUSim simulation results for various applications show that by incorporating the proposed PGS into GPGPU-Sim, we can save leakage energy up to 82%, 38%, and 60% for register files, integer units, and floating units respectively.

                            The leakage power dissipation has become one of the major concerns with technology scaling. The GPGPU register file has
                            grown insize over last decade in order to support the parallel execution of thousands of threads. Given that each thread
                            has its own dedicated setof physical registers, these registers remain idle when correspondingthreads go for long
                            latency operation. Existing research shows that the leakage energy consumption of the register file can be reduced by
                            under volting the idle registers to a data-retentive low-leakage voltage (Drowsy Voltage) to ensure that the data is not
                            lost while not in use. In this paper, we develop a realistic model for determining the wake-up time of registers from
                            various under-volting and power gating modes. Next, we propose a hybrid energy saving technique where a combination of
                            power-gating and under-volting can be usedto save optimum energy depending on the idle period of the registers with a
                            negligible performance penalty. Our simulation shows that the hybrid energy-saving technique results in 94% leakage
                            energy savings in register files on an average when compared with the conventional clock gating technique and 9% higher
                            leakage energy saving compared to the state-of-art technique.

                            The current trend of ever-increasing performance in scientific ap-plications comes with tremendous growth in energy
                            consumption. In this paper, we present a framework for GPU applications, which reduces energy consumption in GPUs through
                            Safe Overclocking and Undervolting (SAOU) without sacrificing performance. The idea is to increase the frequency beyond
                            the safe frequency f_safeMax and undervolt below V_safeMin to get maximum energy saving. Since such overclocking and
                            undervolting may give rise to faults, we employ an enhanced checkpoint-recovery technique to cover the possible
                            errors. Empirically, we explore different errors and derive a fault model that can set the undervolting and overclocking
                            level for maximum energy saving. We target cuBLAS Matrix Multiplication (cuBLAS-MM) kernel for error correction using the
                            checkpoint and recovery(CR) technique as an example of scientific applications. In case of cuBLAS, SAOU achieves up to
                            22% energy reduction through undervolting and overclocking without sacrificing the performance.

                            The current trend of ever-increasing performance in
                            scientific applications comes with tremendous growth in
                            energy consumption.
                            In this paper, we present GreenMM framework for matrix
                            multiplication, which reduces energy consumption in GPUs
                            through undervolting without sacrificing the
                            performance. The idea in thispaper is to undervolt the
                            GPU beyond the minimum operating
                            voltage (Vmin) to save maximum energy while keeping the
                            frequency constant. Since such undervolting may give
                            rise to faults, we design
                            an Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT) algorithm to
                            detectand correct those errors. We target cuBLAS Matrix
                            Multiplication(cuBLAS-MM),
                            as a key kernel used in many scientific applications.
                            Empirically, we explore different errors and derive a
                            fault model as a function of
                            undervolting levels and matrix sizes. Then,using the
                            model, we configure the proposed FT-cuBLAS-MM algorithm.
                            We show that energy
                            consumption is reduced up to 19.8%. GreenMM also
                            improves the GFLOPS/Watt by 9% with negligible
                            performance overhead.

                            GPUs lack fundamental support for
                            data-dependent parallelism and
                            synchronization. While CUDA Dynamic
                            Parallelism signals progress
                            in this direction, many limitations and
                            challenges still remain.
                            This paper introduces WIREFRAME, a
                            hardware-software solution that
                            enables generalized support for
                            data-dependent parallelism and
                            synchronization. Wireframe enables
                            applications to naturally express
                            execution dependencies across different
                            thread blocks through a
                            dependency graph abstraction at run-time,
                            which is sent to the GPU
                            hardware at kernel launch. At run-time, the
                            hardware enforces the
                            dependencies specified in the dependency
                            graph through a
                            dependency-aware thread block scheduler.
                            Overall, Wireframe is
                            able to improve total execution time up to
                            65.20% with an average
                            of 45.07%.

                            Domain-specific SoCs (DSSoCs) are an attractive solution for domains with extremely stringent power, performance, and area constraints. However, DSSoCs suffer from two fundamental complexities. On the one hand, their many specialized hardware blocks result in complex systems and thus high development effort. On the other hand, their many system knobs expand the complexity of design space, making the search for the optimal design difficult. Thus to reach prevalence, taming such complexities is necessary. To address these challenges, in this work, we identify the necessary features of an early-stage design space exploration (DSE) framework that targets the complex design space of DSSoCs and provide an instance of one such framework that we refer to as FARSI.
                            FARSI provides an agile system-level simulator with speed up and accuracy of 8,400x and 98.5% compared to Synopsys Platform Architect.
                            FARSI also provides an efficient exploration heuristic and achieves up to 62x and 35x improvement in convergence time compared to the classic simulated annealing (SA) and modern Multi-Objective Optimistic Search (MOOS). This is done by augmenting SA with architectural reasoning such as locality exploitation and bottleneck relaxation. Furthermore, we embed various co-design capabilities and show that, on average, they have a 32% impact on the convergence rate. 
                            Finally, we demonstrate that using development-cost-aware policies can lower the system complexity, both in terms of the component count and variation by as much as 60% and 82% (e,g., for Network-on-a-Chip subsystem), respectively.

                            The massive parallelism present in GPUs comes at the cost of reduced L1 and L2 cache sizes per thread, leading to
                            serious cache contention problems such as thrashing. Hence, the data access locality of an application should be
                            considered during thread scheduling to improve execution time and energy consumption. Recent works have tried to use the
                            locality behavior of regular and structured applications in thread scheduling, but the difficult case of irregular and
                            unstructured parallel applications remains to be explored.
                            
                            We present PAVER, a priority-aware vertex scheduler, which takes a graph-theoretic approach towards thread scheduling.
                            We analyze the cache locality behavior among thread blocks (TBs) through a just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and represent
                            the problem using a graph representing the TBs and the locality among them. This graph will then be partitioned to TB
                            groups that display maximum data sharing, which are then assigned to the same SM by the locality-aware TB scheduler.
                            
                            Through exhaustive simulation in Fermi, Pascal and Volta architectures using a number of scheduling techniques, we show
                            that our graph theoretic-guided TB scheduler reduces L2 accesses by 43.3%, 48.5%, 40.21% and increases the average
                            performance benefit by 30%, 50.4%, 40.2% for the benchmarks with high inter-TB locality.

Hence, the data access locality of an application should be considered during thread scheduling to improve execution time and energy consumption. Recent works have tried to use the locality behavior of regular and structured applications in thread scheduling, but the difficult case of irregular and unstructured parallel applications remains to be explored.We present PAVER, a Priority-Aware Vertex schedulER, which takes a graph-theoretic approach toward thread scheduling. We analyze the cache locality behavior among thread blocks (TBs) through a just-in-time compilation, and represent the problem using a graph representing the TBs and the locality among them. This graph is then partitioned to TB groups that display maximum data sharing, which are then assigned to the same streaming multiprocessor by the locality-aware TB scheduler. Through exhaustive simulation in Fermi, Pascal, and Volta architectures using a number of scheduling techniques, we show that PAVER reduces L2 accesses by 43.3%, 48.5%, and 40.21% and increases the average performance benefit by 29%, 49.1%, and 41.2% for the benchmarks with high inter-TB locality.},

                            Grid computing has emerged a new field,
                            distinguished from conventional distributed
                            computing. It focuses on large-scale
                            resource sharing, innovative applications
                            and in some cases, high performance
                            orientation. The Grid serves as a
                            comprehensive and complete system for
                            organizations by which the maximum
                            utilization of resources is achieved. The
                            load balancing is a process which involves
                            the resource management and an effective
                            load distribution among the resources.
                            Therefore, it is considered to be very
                            important in Grid systems. For a Grid, a
                            dynamic, distributed load balancing scheme
                            provides deadline control for tasks. Due to
                            the condition of deadline failure,
                            developing, deploying, and executing long
                            running applications over the grid remains a
                            challenge. So, deadline failure recovery is
                            an essential factor for Grid computing. In
                            this paper, we propose a dynamic distributed
                            load-balancing technique called “Enhanced
                            GridSim with Load balancing based on
                            Deadline Failure Recovery” (EGDFR) for
                            computational Grids with heterogeneous
                            resources. The proposed algorithm EGDFR is
                            an improved version of the existing EGDC in
                            which we perform load balancing by providing
                            a scheduling system which includes the
                            mechanism of recovery from deadline failure
                            of the Gridlets. Extensive simulation
                            experiments are conducted to quantify the
                            performance of the proposed load-balancing
                            strategy on the GridSim platform.
                            Experiments have shown that the proposed
                            system can considerably improve Grid
                            performance in terms of total execution
                            time, percentage gain in execution time,
                            average response time, resubmitted time and
                            throughput. The proposed load-balancing
                            technique gives 7 % better performance than
                            EGDC in case of constant number of
                            resources, whereas in case of constant
                            number of Gridlets, it gives 11 % better
                            performance than EGDC.

                            may potentially
                            span many continents. The Grid serves as a
                            comprehensive and complete system for
                            organizations by
                            which the maximum utilization of resources
                            is achieved. The load balancing is a process
                            which involves
                            the resource management and an effective
                            load distribution among the resources.
                            Therefore, it is considered to be very
                            important in Grid systems. The proposed work
                            presents an extensive survey of the
                            existing load balancing techniques proposed
                            so far. These techniques are applicable for
                            various systems
                            depending upon the needs of the
                            computational Grid, the type of environment,
                            resources, virtual
                            organizations and job profile it is supposed
                            to work with. Each of these models has its
                            own merits and
                            demerits which forms the subject matter of
                            this survey. A detailed classification of
                            various load balancing
                            techniques based on different parameters has
                            also been included in the survey.

                            Interconnection networks are used to provide
                            communication between processors and memory
                            modules
                            in a parallel computing environment. In the
                            past years, various interconnection networks
                            have been proposed by
                            many researchers. An interconnection network
                            may suffer from mainly two types of faults:
                            link faults and/or switch
                            fault. Many fault tolerant techniques have
                            also been proposed in the literature. This
                            study makes an extensive survey
                            of various methods of fault tolerance for

                            Recently, the Cube based networks have
                            emerged as attractive interconnection
                            structures in parallel
                            computing systems. In this paper we propose
                            a new interconnection network called crossed
                            cube-mesh which is
                            a product graph of crossed cube and mesh
                            topology. The various topological properties
                            of the new network are
                            derived. The embedding properties,
                            fault-tolerance, node disjoint paths,
                            routing, cost and other performance
                            aspects of the new network are discussed in
                            detail. Based on the comparison, the
                            proposed topologyis proved
                            to be an attractive alternative to the
                            existing Hyper-mesh topology.

                            The interconnection topology plays a vital
                            role in parallel computing systems. In this
                            paper a new interconnection network topology
                            named as Star-mobius cube (SMQ) is
                            introduced. The various topological and
                            performance parameters such as diameter,
                            cost, average distance, and message traffic
                            density are discussed. The embedding and
                            broadcasting aspects of the new network are
                            also presented. Based on the performance
                            analysis, the proposed topology SMQ is
                            proved to be a better alternative to its
                            contemporary networks.

                            In this paper, a Brain Computer Interactive
                            (BCI) robot motion control system for
                            patients’ assistance is designed and
                            implemented. The proposed system acquires
                            data from the patient’s brain through a
                            group of sensors using Emotiv Epoc
                            neuroheadset. The acquired signal is
                            processed. From the processed data the BCI
                            system determines the patient’s requirements
                            and accordingly issues commands (output
                            signals). The processed data is translated
                            into action using the robot as per the
                            patient’s requirement. A Graphics user
                            interface (GUI) is developed by us for the
                            purpose of controlling the motion of the
                            Robot. Our proposed system is quite helpful
                            for persons with severe disabilities and is
                            designed to help persons suffering from
                            spinal cord injuries/ paralytic attacks. It
                            is also helpful to all those who can’t move
                            physically and find difficulties in
                            expressing their needs verbally.
